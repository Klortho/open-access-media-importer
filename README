This set of tools provides the ability to harvest media files from resources
published with liberal reuse licenses, and upload them to Wikimedia Commons
so that they are available for reuse by the various Wikimedia projects.

For example, it can be used to:

  * regularly access PubMed Central (PMC) to locate audio and video files
    published in the supplementary materials of CC BY-licensed articles in the
    Open Access subset
  * convert these files to OGG
  * upload them to Wikimedia Commons, along with the respective metadata

These should also allow easy extension to other CC-BY sources, besides PMC.
A possible future enhancement would be for it to suggest Wikipedia articles for
which a video might be relevant.
