The aim of this project is to write a tool that would:
* regularly spider PubMed Central to locate audio and video files published in the supplementary materials of CC BY-licensed articles in the Open subset
* convert these files to OGG
* upload them to Wikimedia Commons, along with the respective metadata
* provide for easy extension to other CC-BY sources, beyond PubMed Central
* (possibly) suggest Wikipedia articles for which the video might be relevant
